# Morg

This is meant to be a markdown replacement CLI to emulate the same behavior as Emacs Org Mode and some of their extensions.
This may not be a "fully sane" conversion as I only briefly experimented with org-mode.

- [ ] TODOS.
- [ ] Agenda view (as json output)
- [ ] Tangle (In progress)
- [ ] Comments for task use tracking.

## Additional things I would like to personally add as optionals that org does not do.
- [ ] syncing with github issues. (issues.md?) push and pull issues based on a file. Similar to oil.nvim as a file navigator.
- [ ] github project views.
